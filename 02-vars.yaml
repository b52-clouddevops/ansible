# How do your print a variable in bash ????  ${varName}
# To print a vairable in yaml, we will {{varName}}

# Varaible name has to be enclosed in quotes only if it's the only entity in the msg, if not you don't have to place them in quotes. 
# Always prefer to keep the task name different ; In version, it used to throw error. In version 7, that's deprecated.

# Ansible throws you an error if you use a variable that is not declared  ; In bash, it assume it as a empty variable.
